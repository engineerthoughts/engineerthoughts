			<h3>EARLY LIFE:</h3>
			<p>Bhoothath is considered second in the list of the three principal azhwars, 
			with the other two being Poigai Azhwar and Pey Azhwar, 
			collectively called Muthalamazhwargal who are known to be born out of divinity. 
			As per Hindu legend, Bhoothath was found in a liquorice flower in Thirukadalmallai (modern-day Mahabalipuram).

		<h3>SMALL STORY:</h3>
			<p>It was day time at thirukkovalur, but it darkened and started raining heavily. 
			The wandering Poigai azhwar found out a small hide out, which has a space for one person to lie down. 
			Boodath azhwar arrived there looking for a hiding place and Poigai azhwar accommodated him, with both sitting together. 
			In the meanwhile, Peyazhwar also came to the same place as all the three preferred to stand because of lack of space. 
			The darkness became dense and inside the small room, they were not able to see each other. 
			In the meanwhile, they felt a fourth person also forced his way among them. 
			The three azhwars realised from the light of the lightning that the fourth one had a charming face that was sublime and divine. 
			The trio could immediately realize that it was Vishnu who was huddling among them.
			</p>
			
		<img src="../../alvar/poigaiazhwar/mudal.jpg" alt="Temple tank in Yathothkari Perumal Temple where Poigai Azhwar originated" width='100%'></img>
			<p>Poigai Azhwar wished to see His face continuously but the lightening was playing the hide and seek game. With a view to maintain the continuity of light and never miss the view of the divine face, he instantly composed 100 songs wishing the earth to be a big pot full of ghee of ocean where the sun could be the burning wick.
				<br><br>Bhoothathazhwar then sang 100 songs imagining to light the lamp constantly through ardent love for Him.<br><br>
				“Anbe Thagliyaa Aarvame Neyyaaga<br>
				Inburugu Chintai Idu Thiriyaa<br>
				Nanpurugi Gnaana Chudar Vilakku Etrinen<br>
				Naaranarku Gnaana Thamizh Purindha Naan”<br><br>
				Meaning:<br><br>
				I who wrote this song that bestows wisdom, with love as the lamp, endearing involvement as the 
				lubricant ghee and knowledge as the wick of the burning torch, dedicated myself to the service of the Lord.
				The third one Peiazhwar sang another 100 songs where he could describe the enchanting 
				charm of the divine face and described the association of Narayana equipped with Chakra and Sankha, and His divine consort goddess Lakshmi.

		<h3>STYLE OF COMPOSITION:</h3>
			<p>Bhoothath Azhwar’s composition are set in the Andhadhi style.
			The word “Andha” means “end” and “Adi” means “beginning”.
			The most noteworthy feature of the work is that the ending word or the syllable 
			of each verse becomes the beginning word of the succeeding verse and the last word 
			of the hundredth verse becomes the beginning of the first verse, thus making
			the hundred verses a true garland of verses.

		<h3>VARIOUS REFERENCE:</h3>
			<h3>Upadesa Rathinamala (Pasuram 4)</h3>
			<p>Poygaiar Bhuthatthar Peyar , Pukazh Mazhisai<br>
				Ayyan Arulmaran Seralrkkon --Thuyya Bhatta<br>
				Nathan Anbar Thall Thuli Narr Paanan Nann Kaliyan<br>
				Ithivar Thorratthu Adaivu Aam Inghu<br> </p>

			
			<B>MEANING:</B><br><br>
			<p>
			The order of avatharam of the Azhwars in this earth is: Poigai Azhwar is First; 
			Bhutham Azhwar is second; Peiazhwar is third; the reputed Thirumazhisai Piran is fourth; 
			Nammazhwar of illustrious grace (Arul) is fifth; Kulasekara azhwar is the sixth ; 
			the sacred Periyazhwar free of any blemish is the seventh;  Thondaradippodi azhwar 
			(Bhakthangri Renu) is the eighth; Thiruppaan azhwar, the parama saathvikar is the ninth in order; 
			dear Thirumangai azhwar is tenth .This then is the order in which they incarnated on Bhumandalam .
			(One may wonder about the absence of ANDAL and Madhura Kavi in the above list. Sri Manavala Mamunigal 
			pays special attention to them later slokas of Upadesa Rathinamala).</p>
			
			<h3>Upadesa Rathinamala (Pasuram 6)</h3>
			<p>Iyppasiyil Onam Avittam Sathayamivai<br>
				Oppilavam Nalkal Ulahatthir !--Yeppuviyum<br>
				Pesu Pukazh Poykayar Bhuthatthar Peyazhwar<br>
				Tesudane Thonru Sirappal.<br>
				 </p>

			
			<B>MEANING:</B><br><br>
			<p>
			In this pasuram, Manavala Mamunigal tells, Oh, People of the World! Poigai azhwar, 
			Bhuthath azhwar And Peiazhwars have the distinct fame of being eulogized in every 
			corner of the World.  If we were to ask as to which were the days in which they 
			incarnated on this earth with their radiances, then they are Iyppasi Sravanam, Avittam and Sathayam respectively.</p>

		<h3>Why they got the name of Mudhal Azhwars?</h3>
			<p>Marrulla Aazhwarkalukku Munne Vanthu Uthitthu<br>
			Narramizhal Nool Seythu Naattai Uyttha -Perrimaiyor<br>
			Yenru Mudhal Aazhwarkal Yennum Peyar Ivarkku<br>
			Ninrathu Ulahatthe Nihazhnthu<br><br>
			By incarnating on this earth before the remaining seven Azhwars and by offering 
			(to the people of the world) the means of salvation through the Divya Prabandhams of Mudhal Thiruvandhadhi, 
			Irandam Thiruvandhadhi and Moondram Thiruvandhadhi, the first three Azhwars earned the name "Mudhalazhwars" 
			-- a reference that has come to stay since then.
