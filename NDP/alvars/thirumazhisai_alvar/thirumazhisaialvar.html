			<h3>EARLY LIFE:</h3>

		<h3>SMALL STORY:</h3>
			<p>He was born to Bhargava maharishi and his wife Kanakangi after an unusual 12 months stay in the womb. 
			The fetus came out as just a lifeless lump of flesh with no arms and legs.
			The couple were terribly depressed and with unwillingness left it under a bamboo bush 
			and proceeded with their spiritual journey. 
			Vishnu appeared with his consort and blessed the "flesh" with their kataksham and it turned into an lively human being.<br><br>
			He was later picked up with both the arms affectionately by a tribal named Thiruvalan. 
			A really blessed couple Thiruvalan and Pankajavalli, was overwhelmed by the grace of god for this gift of a baby. 
			The boy grew on to become Thirumazhisai azhwar. The couple also had a son named Kanikannan. <br><br>
			The Azhwar learnt the vedas as he was growing up. He studied other religions and their merits 
			versus demerits before being convinced of the superiority of Lord Narayana.<br><br>
			Then the Azhwar went to a shrine called Tiruvekka and stayed there along with Kanikannan to serve the lord. 
			In the city of KanchIpuram during the reign of Pallava king Parameswaran I,
			Azhwar was pleased with the services rendered by an old lady at the Thiruvekka temple 
			and restored her to her youthful form so that she could continue to render service to the Lord for a long time. 
			The king was attracted by the beauty of this lady and married her. <br><br>
			However, he wanted his own youth returned to
			him too and he asked the assistant of the Azhwar (Kanikannan) to convey that desire to his guru. 
			The disciple refused to do such a command. Consequently the king banished Kanikannan out of his country. 
			The Azhwar walked out with him and requested that the Lord of the temple too do likewise. 
			The request is described in the following poem which means, “Kanikannan is leaving, oh Lord. 
			You should not stay here since I am also leaving. Roll up your (serpent) bed and let us go” <br><br>

					
			Kanikannan Poginran Kamaru Poongachi <br>
			Manivanna Neekida Venda -- Tunivudaiya<br>
			Sennap Pulavanum Selginren Niyum Unran<br>
			Painnagap Pay Suruttik Kol.<br><br>
			
			The Lord obeyed the dictates of His devotee again. 
			Accordingly the Lord at Thiruvekka is called “Yatoktakari” 
			or “Sonna vannam seyda Perumal” (The Lord who did what He was told to do).<br>
