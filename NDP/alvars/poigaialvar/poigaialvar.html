			<h3>EARLY LIFE:</h3>
			<p>Poigai azhwar was found in a small pond near the Yadhotakaari temple at Tiruvekkaa. 
			In Tamil, small pond is called poigai, and since he was found in a pond, he got the name Poigai azhwar.

		<h3>SMALL STORY:</h3>
			<p>It was day time at thirukkovalur, but it darkened and started raining heavily. 
			The wandering Poigai azhwar found out a small hide out, which has a space for one person to lie down. 
			Boodath azhwar arrived there looking for a hiding place and Poigai azhwar accommodated him, with both sitting together. 
			In the meanwhile, Peyazhwar also came to the same place as all the three preferred to stand because of lack of space. 
			The darkness became dense and inside the small room, they were not able to see each other. 
			In the meanwhile, they felt a fourth person also forced his way among them. 
			The three azhwars realised from the light of the lightning that the fourth one had a charming face that was sublime and divine. 
			The trio could immediately realize that it was Vishnu who was huddling among them.
			</p>

			<p>Poigai Azhwar lit the place using the world as a lamp, the ocean as the oil and sun as the light.
				Bhuthathazhwar lit the place using his love as lamp, his attachment as the oil and his mind as the light.
				Peyazhwar, being helped by the other two Azhwars, sees the glowing beauty of emperuman who is with his piratti, 
				thiruvazhi and thiruchchangu and performs mangalasasanam for the serthi.

		<h3>MUDHAL THIRUVANDADHI:</h3>
			<p>Poigai azhwar wished to see Vishnu's face continuously but could view only from the simmering light of the lightning. 
			With a view to maintain the continuity of light, he instantly composed hundred songs wishing the earth to be a big pot full of 
			ghee like an ocean where the Sun could be the burning wick.<br><br>
			"Vaiyam Thagaliya Varkadale Neyyaga<br>
			Veyya Kadhiron Vilakkaga - Seyya<br>
			Sudar Azhiyan Adikke Suttinen Sol Malai<br>
			Idarazhi Ningkugave Enru"<br>
			</p>

		<h3>MEANING:</h3>
			<p>Deeming in the world as bowl, the full sea as ghee, the fierce-rayed sun as a luminous wick, 
			I have twined a garland of speech for the feet of Him who wields the red flaming discus 
			so that there may be freedom from the ocean of misery.

		<h3>THANIYAN:</h3>
			<p>Thaniyan for Mudhal Thiruvandhadhi was divined by Mudhaliyandan:<br>
			"Kaidhai ser poompozhilsuzh kachchi nagar vandhudhiththa<br>
			poygaip piran kavinjar poreru - vaiyaththu<br>
			adiyavargal vazha arunthamizh nurrandhadhi<br>
			padivilangkach seydhan parindhu"
			</p>
			<p>
			<B>MEANING:</B><br><br>			
			Kanchi derives its name from Brahma who is known as ka, who worshipped the Lord in this kshetra. 
			In that famed city, in a lotus flower within a lotus pond, under the star Thiruvonam (Sravanam) 
			which is the star of the Lord Himself, Poigai azhwar was born. 
			He gave the wonderful Mudhal Thiruvandhadhi Pasuram which is like a lamp that drives away the darkness of the mind and lifts the soul up.
