			which are recited by devotees during the winter festival season of Margazhi.

				<h3>BIRTH STORY:</h3>
				<p>A great vedic scholar, poet, Vishnu devotee also known as Periyazhvar found the divine child under a 
				tulasi plant while he was tending his nandavanam(garden) in Srivilliputhur. 
				He brought her up in simple and godly surroundings natural to a pious, vedic, dhwaija. 
				The child prodigy thus fostered lovingly grew into a beautiful maiden and became an embodiment of love for Sri Krishna. <br><br>
				Being a devotee of "Sri Vadabhatrasayee", the presiding deity of Srivilliputhur, 
				Vishnuchitha would weave a garland of tulasi leaves daily and keep it sacredly rolled in a flower basket so that he may, 
				after attending to his other course, take the garland later to the temple for offering to the lord.<br><br>
				<center><img src="../../alvar/periyalvar/vadapadrasayee.jpg" alt="vadapathrasayee temple" width='100%'>
			(Vadapathrasayee Temple)</img></center><br>
				On a particular day, when the garland was handed over by Vishnuchittar to the priest for decorating the Lord, 
				there was a strand of human hair sticking to the flowers. On seeing this, the priest got furious and chided Vishnuchittar. 
				What a grave offence this is! he said. <br><br>
				How come there is a hair in the garland? Do you not know that only the purest of things are offered to the Lord? 
				Take this back! Saying thus, he flung the garland back into the hands of Vishnuchittar who was trembling with shame and embarrassment. 
				He could not figure out how a hair could have got into the garland when he was taking so much care to weave the garland. 
				With a heavy heart, he walked back to his home, mentally tired with the shock and shame he had faced in the temple. <br><br>
				That night, Vishnuchittar could not sleep. He could not figure out wherefrom a long hair could attach itself to this 
				garland he made with so much of devotion and care. His questions had no answer and he spent the night with not a wink.<br><br>
					<center><img src="../../alvar/andal/andal_garland.jpg" alt="Andal wearing the garland" width='100%'>
			</img></center><br>
				In the morning, as usual he collected the flowers and made them into a beautiful garland. That day too, he left the garland 
				and went out but came back almost immediately when the sight he saw shocked him. 
				The little Kothai was wearing the garland and admiring her beauty in the mirror. 
				Blasphemy! he cried out aloud, much to the shock of the little girl who was taken aback on seeing her father see her wearing the garland. 
				Blasphemy! What can I do now? Vishnuchittar lamented beating himself on his forehead. 
				I have committed a grave sin! There is no recourse for me! Narayana! Narayana! 
				The little girl unable to watch her father lament thus started to cry. <br><br>
				Vishnuchittar was in no mood to pacify her. 
				He threw away the garland and went and plucked flowers again and made a garland and left for the temple immediately. 
				That night Lord Narayana appeared in the dream of Vishnuchittar. Why have you discarded the garland worn by Kothai? demanded he. 
				I will henceforth wear only the garland worn by her as it contains the scent of her pure devotion. <br><br>
				Please do as I wish! As the Lord disappeared, Vishnuchittar got up with a start, 
				realising that his daughter was no ordinary being but the incarnation of the Goddess. 
				He was overwhelmed, and from that day, the garland for the Lord was first worn by Kothai. 
				She became to be known as Andal or one who ruled the Lord. She was also known as Choodi Kodutha Sudarkodi.<br><br>
				As she grew up, Vishnuchittar was worried about her marriage and that he should find a good groom for her. 
				Andal, on the other hand had her mind transfixed on Lord Krishna who was Narayana himself, whom only she saw as her bridegroom. 
				No mortal will I marry! she said much to the surprise of all. <br><br>
				I will marry only Lord Krishna! She meditated upon the Lord, praying to him every day. 
				Every morning in the month of Margazhi, she would wake her friends up and after having a bath in the cold waters, 
				go about singing the praise of Lord Krishna through hymns known as Tiruppavai which was composed by her. 
				She urged the other friends of hers also to pray to the Lord Krishna in the month of Margazhi.<br><br>
				Vishnuchittar was getting more and more worried about the future of Kothai. 
				One day, Lord Ranganatha whose abode is Srirangam, appeared in the dream of Vishnuchittar and expressed his desire to marry Kothai. 
				He instructed Vishnuchittar to bring Kothai to Srirangam bedecked as a bride where He would accept her as his wife. 
				Vishnuchittar, who was elated, at this dream of his, conveyed this to his patron and friend King Vallabha Deva Pandya 
				who made all arrangements for Kothai to be brought in a palanquin bedecked in all bridal finery, 
				accompanied by an array of elephants and horses which was a symbol of status, along with lot of gifts for the Lord.

		<h3>ANDAL'S GARLANDS:</h3>	
		<p>
		The Ranganatha of Thiruvarangam Ranganathaswamy temple married Andal, who later merged with the idol.<br><br>
		
		<li>ANDAL GARLAND AND TIRUPATI VENKATESWARA:</li><br>
		For Tirupati Brahmotsavam, garlands worn to Andal in Srivilliputhur temple are sent to Venkateswara Temple at Tirupati in Andhra Pradesh. 
		These traditional garlands are made of tulasi, sevanthi and sampangi flowers. 
		These garlands are worn to Lord Venkateswara during Garuda seva procession. 
		Every year Tirupati Venkateswara’s garland is sent to Srivilliputtur Andal for marriage festival of Andal.<br><br>
		
		<li>KALLAZHAGAR</li><br>
		Andal garland is being sent to Madurai Kallazhagar for Chithirai Festival day.<br><br>

		<h3>LITERARY WORKS:</h3>	
		<p>
		<li>THIRUPPAVAI:</li><br>
		Her first work is the Thiruppavai, a collection of 30 verses in which Andal imagines herself to be a Gopi, 
		one of the cowherd girls known for their unconditional devotion to Lord Krishna. 
		In these verses, she describes her yearning to serve Lord Vishnu and achieve happiness not just in this lifetime, but for all eternity. 
		She also describes the religious vows (pavai) that she and her fellow cowherd girls will observe for this purpose. 
		It is said that Thiruppavai is the nectar of Vedas and teaches philosophical values, moral values, ethical values, 
		pure love, devotion, dedication, single-minded aim, virtues, and the ultimate goal of life.<br><br>
		
		<li>NACHIAR TIRUMOZHI:</li><br>
		The second work by Andal is the Nachiar Tirumozhi, a poem of 143 verses. 
		"Thirumozhi" literally means "Sacred Sayings" in a Tamil poetic style and "Nachiar" means Goddess. 
		Therefore, the title means "Sacred Sayings of the Goddess." This poem fully reveals Andal's intense longing for Vishnu, the Divine Beloved. 
		Utilizing classical Tamil poetic conventions and interspersing stories from the Vedas and Puranas, 
		Andal creates imagery that is possibly unparalleled in the whole gamut of Indian religious literature.<br><br>
