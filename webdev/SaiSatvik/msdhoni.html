<p id="hello">Dhoni's services were contracted by the Chennai Super Kings for US$1.5 million in IPL's inaugural season in 2008. He was
the most expensive player in the IPL for the first season auctions. Dhoni captained Chennai Super Kings to victory in 2010 
and 2011 and 2018 Indian Premier League titles and the 2010 and 2014 Champions League T20 titles.
After the CSK was banned for two years, Dhoni was subsequently bought by Rising Pune Supergiant for US$1.9 Million in 2016.
He was the captain that year but after his team finished in 7th place he was replaced by Steven Smith.
MS Dhoni’s CSK reached the final for a record 8th time in 2019 but was stopped by a resurgent Mumbai Indians side which won 
the final by a whisker<p>
